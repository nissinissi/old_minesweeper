A minesweeper implementation in Pygame (Python 2.7) that I wrote a few years ago.

The code is a bit messy and there are quite a few things I'd change if I had to do it again, but I do recall having a lot of fun writing it.

BTW, I'm not sure if it's allowed to upload the font files I used in the project. If you can obtain the files (which is recommendable), put them in the same directory as `main.py` and set the constant `HAVE_FONTS` to `True`.
