A minesweeper implementation in Pygame (Python 2.7) that I wrote a few years ago.

The code is a bit messy and there are quite a few things I'd change if I had to do it again, but I do recall having a lot of fun writing it.

BTW, I'm not sure if I have permission to upload the font files I used in the project. If you'd like to run the game, I recommend obtaining the files, putting them in the same directory as `main.py` and setting the constant `HAVE_FONTS` (in `main.py`) to `True`.
