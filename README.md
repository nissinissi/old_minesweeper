A minesweeper implementation in Pygame (Python 2.7) that I wrote a few years ago.

The code is a bit messy and there are quite a few things I'd change if I had to write it again, but I do recall having a lot of fun writing it.

BTW, pretty sure I can't upload the fonts I used in the project. If you can obtain the font files in a legal way, put them in the same directory as `main.py` and set the constant `HAVE_FONTS` to `True`.
